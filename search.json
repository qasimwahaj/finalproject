I am excited to share my website, which presents my final impact evaluation project for the Research Evaluation class that I have taken during Spring 2023.\nIn this project, I built a model to evaluate the impact of the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) Career Development Program on economic empowerment of refugees and displaced individuals in Atlanta. My knowledge of the program’s inner workings come from interning at IRC for over three months. By employing quantitative methodologies and synthetic data analysis and econometric models like Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW), I aim to provide a model to analyze the program’s impact on economic empowerment of its beneficiaries.\n\n\nDisclaimer!!: This article is an independent work and is not approved by IRC. The author is solely response for the content and any mistakes found in this article.\nThis project will provide an evaluation framework for the IRC’s Career Development Program and programs of similar nature implemented by other resettlement agencies in the United State. Conducting program evaluation for this program will contribute to the existing body of knowledge about refugee resettlement programs, with the potential to inform policy-making decisions and improve the design and implementation of similar initiatives in the future."

The IRC provides a range of programs and services, including health care, education, and economic development support, to help individuals and communities recover and rebuild after conflict or disaster (IRC, n.d). One of the services provided by the IRC across the world is career development and readiness services. This programs might differ across different locations. This program evaluation is primarily based on the career development program provided at the IRC’s Atlanta office. However, this model can be used to measure the impact of similar career readiness programs designed for refugee population in the United States. The purpose of the IRC’s career development program is to support refugees in building their skills, knowledge, and experience to succeed in the U.S. workforce. The program is designed to provide career advising, job training, vocational education and other support to help participants achieve their career goals and improve their economic stability. While the program is expected to provide many positive outcomes for refugee clients, this impact evaluation design is interested on the economic empowerment impact of the program since the Career Development Program is run under the Economic Empowerment Program (IRC-RITA, n.d.).\nWhile the Early Employment Program at IRC assist clients with basic or no English proficiency, the Career Development program assists clients who have at least intermediate English proficiency and familiarity with computer and technological tools. We determine eligibility through our English Proficiency test and our intake survey. The purpose of the career development program is to support refugees in building their skills, knowledge, and experience to succeed in the U.S. workforce. The program provides career advising, job training, vocational education, and other support to help participants achieve their career goals and improve their economic stability. The career development program is designed to provide comprehensive support to refugees, addressing not only their immediate job search needs but also their long-term career goals. Career coaches work with clients to develop personalized career plans, identify job opportunities, and provide training on job search strategies, interview skills, and workplace communication. Additionally, the program provides vocational training opportunities in fields that align with clients’ skills and interests, as well as job placement assistance. The Career Development Program primarily is primarily consisting of two components:\n\n1. Career Counseling\nEach client will be assigned a career coach who will work with them one-on-one to develop a career plan, set goals, and identify potential job opportunities. Clients will receive training on resume writing, job search strategies, interview skills, and workplace communication. Additionally, the program provides job placement assistance. The program will work with local employers to identify job openings and facility ate job placements for clients who have completed the job readiness training and career coaching components.\n\n\n2. Vocational Training\nClients will have the opportunity to participate in vocational training programs that align with their skills and interests in areas such as data analytics, nursing, dental assistance and information technology. The IRC Atlanta partners with several educational institutions. They also assist refugee clients with their application as well as provide tuition assistance on a case-by-case basis and based on the availability of funding.\n\n\n3. Employer Engagement\nThe career development program cultivates partnerships with employers to support clients in securing employment opportunities and addresses any issues that may arise. This relationship enables the career development team to provide the necessary support for clients to succeed in their jobs and for employers to effectively manage a diverse workforce.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nInternational Rescue Committee.

The directional arrows in the model portray the causal connections between these components, highlighting how inputs initiate activities, which then produce outputs, leading to outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IRC’s Career Development Program relies on five distinct resources, including participants, personnel, funding, partnerships, and office supplies. These resources facilitate participant assessment, involving English proficiency testing, intake surveying, and job qualification surveys to identify their career and educational needs. Based on the results, the program provides career readiness services customized to participants’ career goals and interests, empowering them to gain the necessary skills and knowledge for employment or career advancement. The program’s primary outputs are the number of participants completing the program, enhancing their skills, and improving their job prospects, leading to increased income and economic empowerment. Ultimately, this leads to improved economic and social integration within their communities."

    "text": "The program is expected to yield many positive outcomes, including skill development, improved employment outcomes, increased self-esteem and confidence, among others. For this program evaluation project, however, we are only interested in measuring the impact of the program on economic empowerment of refugees. We measure economic empowerment by the amount of dollar increase in hourly wages reported by clients six months after the completion of the program.\nWe predict that participation in the program significantly increases income. However, there are a number of other confounding factors that both affect why someone chooses to participate in the program and the have higher income. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) helps us identify confounders so that we can isolate the impact of the program on income. Job placement and skills development are intervening variables through which the the program affects income. Therefore, we don’t need to adjust for them. However, the black arrows in the DAG show the confounding effects that must be adjusted.\n\nIn this model, we assume that those without employment are more likely to participate in the program and have lower earnings. For employed individuals, we assume that those with higher income and job satisfaction are less likely to participate. Age is also a significant factor, as older individuals are more likely to participate due to lack of skills and potentially earn more due to experience. Social support networks play a huge role, as those with stronger networks are less likely to participate in the program and have higher earnings. Legal status also confounds the relationship, as those with better status are more likely to receive resources and attention. Race and education also influence participation and income. We assume that refugees from less developed countries are more likely to participate, and those with higher education and income are less likely to participate. Male refugees and those with better English proficiency are more likely to participate. Also, we assume that those who reach out to the program to get enrolled could be fundamentally different from those who are reffered by the other departments at IRC, and thus that needs to be controlled adjusted. Finally, we make the assumption that time spent in the U.S. decreases the likelihood of participation as refugees and immigrants less in need of such programs ."

    "text": "Although Randomized Control Trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard, they are not feasible for our program due to ethical concerns given that refugees and immigrants are the program participants. Therefore, we will use observational data from surveys completed by program beneficiaries as well as data from other refugee clients of the IRC who receive non-career-related services as our control group.\nOur goal is to have a sample size of 1,200 participants, with 600 in the treatment group and 600 in the control group, which is appropriate for our program. However, if we expand the model to beneficiaries across the entire United States, we may need to increase the sample size. We will need to collect two surveys, one at the time of program enrollment and another six months after the program. The survey questions will includes questions about and based on the variables identified in the DAG presented in the outcome and hypothesis page.\nTo determine the program’s impact on income, we must eliminate the arrows leading to both the program and income variables. We will use Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) method is a superior approach to traditional method of controlling in a regression model because it accounts for non-linear relationships. To apply IPW, we will use logistic regression to generate a propensity score for each observation, estimating the likelihood of program participation based on the confounding variables in the DAG. We will then assign weights to each observation based on these scores, giving greater importance to observations that deviate from expected participation. By incorporating these weights into our regression model, we can estimate the program’s impact on income while accounting for confounding variables."

    "text": "The career development program is designed to address the unique challenges faced by refugees and recent immigrants in securing employment, such as lack of education and work experience, cultural differences, and discrimination (Colic-Peisker & Tilbury, 2006; Yakushko et al., 2008). Existing evidence suggests that occupational training programs have had a positive impact on the employment outcomes of these populations. For instance, the Hope-Action Theory-based career development program has been shown to have a significant positive impact on the employment outcomes of refugees (Yoon et al., 2019). Additionally, Narrative Career Counseling has been found to be an effective approach for supporting the career development of individuals with refugee backgrounds (Abkhezr & McMahon, 2017).\nTherefore, the Career Development Program is developed based on the impact theory that it will help refugees develop skills, and find decent jobs, achieve economic empowerment through higher income, leading to improved social and economic integration into their communities. Economic empowerment is important because it can lead to improved living conditions, increased access to healthcare and education, and greater social and political participation. By providing refugees with the tools and resources they need to succeed in the U.S. workforce, the program aims to help them rebuild their lives and contribute to their new communities. The following graph shows how the program theoretically lead to different positive outcomes for beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAbkhezr, P., & McMahon, M. (2017).

synthetic that we just created and Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to estimate the impact of the program on dollar amount increase in income. The IPW method allows us to adjusting for the confounding factors that may affect enrollment in the program and the outcome. To do this, we assign a probability of receiving the program to each observation based on their characteristics in the confounding variables. In this method, the observations that were predicted to receive the program but did not, or vice versa, are given more weight than those that behave the way predicted, and that is how we adjust for confounders. The process of generating these weights involves two steps.\nFirst, we generate propensity scores, which represent the probability of receiving the program.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_logit &lt;- glm(program ~ age + male + pre_income + num_relatives +\n                   legal_status + race + education + employment +\n                   job_satisfaction + english_level + referral +\n                   time_since_arrival, \n                     data = data_neat,\n                   family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nprogram_probabilities &lt;- augment_columns(model_logit,\n                                     data_neat,\n                                     type.predict = \"response\") %&gt;%\n  # The predictions are in a column named \".fitted\", so we rename it here\n  rename(propensity = .fitted)\n\n\nSecond, we use a specific formula to convert these scores into weights, giving more weight to observations that deviate from program enrollment based on propensity score.\n\n\nCode\nprogram_ipw &lt;- program_probabilities %&gt;%\n  mutate(ipw = (program / propensity) + ((1 - program) / (1 - propensity)))\n\n\nBy incorporating these inverse probability weights into our regression model, we can estimate the program's impact on dollar amount increase in predicted income.\n\nFindings\nAs predicted, the result of our regression analysis suggest that participation in IRC’s Career Development Program leads to a statistically significant increase in predicted income leading to economic empowerment of refugee clients. Specifically, in our sample, program participation increases predicted income by $2 per hour on average. This effect can be generalized to the broader refugee population in the United States. At a 95% confidence level, we estimate that participation in IRC’s career development program increases refugee predicted income by between $1.7 and $2.4 per hour.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_ipw &lt;- lm(income ~ program,\n                data = program_ipw,\n                weights = ipw)\n\nmodelsummary(list(\" Regression Model with IPW\" = model_ipw),\n             conf_level = 0.95,\n             stars = TRUE,\n             statistic = c(\"t = {statistic}\",\n                                   \"conf.int\"),\n             fmt = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Regression Model with IPW\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n16.06***\n\n\n\nt = 122.46\n\n\n\n[15.80, 16.32]\n\n\nprogram\n2.07***\n\n\n\nt = 11.13\n\n\n\n[1.70, 2.43]\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n1200\n\n\nR2\n0.094\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.093\n\n\nAIC\n6250.5\n\n\nBIC\n6265.7\n\n\nLog.Lik.\n−3122.232\n\n\nF\n123.810\n\n\nRMSE\n3.22\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can graphically show the statistical significance in the following plot:\n\n\nCode\nplot_data &lt;- tidy(model_ipw, conf.int = TRUE) %&gt;% filter(term == \"program\")\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = estimate, y = term)) + \n  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), size = 2, linewidth = 1.7, color = \"blue\") +  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dotted\", size = 1.5) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(x = \"Dollar Increase in Hourly Income\", y = \"\", title = \"The Effect of the Program in Null World\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n       plot.margin = unit(c(1.1,2,1.1,1), \"cm\")) +\n xlim(-.5, 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot indicates that the likelihood of obtaining the effect size of $2.07 is extremely unlikely in a scenario where there is no effect. The red dotted line serves as a reference for the scenario of no effect. Therefore, we can confidently concluded that the program has a significant effect on increasing income."

    "text": "In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis in evidence-based program development and implementation in both the public and nonprofit sectors. This shift towards data-driven decision-making recognizes the importance of collecting and analyzing accurate data to evaluate the effectiveness of programs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of IRC’s Career Development Program for refugees by measuring its impact on economic empowerment, as its primary outcome. Our analysis of the program’s impact, based on simulated data, revealed a significant positive effect on the economic empowerment of refugees through increased income. Our results suggest that similar programs should be developed and expanded across the United States to support refugees’ socio-economic integration. This program evaluation represents an essential step towards evidence-based program development and implementation in the nonprofit sector, providing a model for evaluation of future programs with similar nature."

    "text": "1. One-on-one Counseling\nEach client will be assigned a career coach who will work with them one-on-one to develop a career plan, set goals, and identify potential job opportunities. Clients will receive training on resume writing, job search strategies, interview skills, and workplace communication. Additionally, the program provides job placement assistance. The program will work with local employers to identify job openings and facility ate job placements for clients who have completed the job readiness training and career coaching components.\n\n2. Vocational Training\nClients will have the opportunity to participate in vocational training programs that align with their skills and interests. Examples of programs include healthcare, technology, and construction. The IRC Atlanta partners with several educational institutions. They also assist refugee clients with their application as well as provide tuition assistance on a case-by-case basis and based on the availability of funding.\n\n3. Employer Engagement\nThe career development program cultivates partnerships with employers to support clients in securing employment opportunities and addresses any issues that may arise. This relationship enables the career development team to provide the necessary support for clients to succeed in their jobs and for employers to effectively manage a diverse workforce.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nInternational Rescue Committee.
